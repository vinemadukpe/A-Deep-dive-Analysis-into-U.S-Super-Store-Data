## KPIs

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are essential metrics that business and financial analyst uses to evaluate the success of specific activities in any business or financial institution. 


In this analysis, I paid attention on the striking KPIs that will help the management of U.S super store to understand their performance and also guide them in decision making for future progress.

## Below are Some KPIs Formula:

- Total Revenue = Summation of total sales 
- Total Profit =  Summation of total profit 
- Sales Rate = Number of Unit Sold / Time Period
- Profit Margin = (Total profit / Total revenue) *100
- Average Sales = Total Revenue / Number of Transactions
- Average Profit = Total Profit / Number of Transactions 

In Fig.2, i tabulated the values of some KPIs gotten from the analysis of 2014-2017 sales data from US super store using the formula above.

In 2014, sales peaked on 3/18/2014 and also flattened immidiately as shown in fig.4, this spike could be as a result of Easter celebration.

In fig.5 below, we can observe that the profit trend does not follow the sales trend because it peaked on 12/20/2014. This spike in profit trend could equally be as a result of festivity in the month of December when sellers tends to hike prices to make homongus profit.

## Insight From 2015 Sales Data

Fig.6 is the result obtained from the 2015 sales data extracted from the 2014-2017 US super store sales data, from the calculation we can observer that there was not a significant increase in sales between 2014 and 2015.

While profit peaked on 11/20/2015. All these indicators both in 2014 and 2015 sales and profit trend are pointing out the fact that the store does well during festive seasons'

## Some Financial/Insightful Questions

-  Can we identify the highest and lowest performing segments in terms of sales?

-  What are the characteristic of top performing segment and how can we target the demography?
---
  We can observe from  Fig.9a and Fig.9b below that *Consumer Segment* drives to total sales. It can equally be seen That The Consumer ‘Products’ Which Drives The Total Sales (50.56%) Is Selling More In The Western Region. This Could Be Due To The Fact That There Are More Private Citizens Who Are Neither Into Corporate Jobs Nor Work From Home Residing In That Region. as in fig.9a and fig.9b.

## Geographical Analysis

-  Does Sales vary across different region?
-  Are there specific areas or location where the company need to focus to drive sales?

From *fig.10a and fig.10b* below it can be seen that sales and profits significantly varies across the regions where both are high in the West and relatively good in the East but very low in the South. this means that effective marketing and other drastic actions need to be taken to improve sales in the South.

  # Conclusion
  In conlusion, i made a general observation which i visualize in *fig.13a and fig.13b* below

  *Fig.13a*

  I plotted sales and profit for the dataset 2014-2017 side-by-side, the result clearly shows that high volume sales of a particular product does not necessarily translate to high profit yield from such product.
