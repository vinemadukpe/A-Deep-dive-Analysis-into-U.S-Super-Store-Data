## KPIs

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are essential metrics that business and financial analyst uses to evaluate the success of specific activities in any business or financial institutions. 


In this analysis, I paid attention on the striking KPIs that will help the management of U.S super store to understand their performance and also guide the them in decision making for future progress.

## Below are Some KPIs Formula:

- Total Revenue = Summation of total sales 
- Total Profit =  Summation of total profit 
- Sales Rate = Number of Unit Sold / Time Period
- Profit Margin = (Total profit / Total revenue) *100
- Average Sales = Total Revenue / Number of Transactions
- Average Profit = Total Profit / Number of Transactions 

In Fig.2, i tabulated the values of some KPIs gotten from the analysis of 2014-2017 sales data from US super store using the formula above.

In 2014, sales peaked on 3/18/2014 and also flattened immidiately as shown in fig.4, this spike could be as a result of Easter celebration.

In fig.5 below, we can observe that the profit trend does not follow the sales trend because it peaked on 12/20/2014. This spike in profit trend could equally be as a result of festivity in the month of December when sellers tends to hike prices to make homongus profit.

-  Can we identify the highest and lowest performing segments in terms of sales?

-  What are the characteristic of top performing segment and how can we target the demography?
  Fig.9a and Fig.9b answers the first question

*Fig.9b*
WE can observe that *Consumer Segment* drives sales. I equally Observed That The Consumer ‘Products’ Which Drives The Total Sales (50.56%) Is Selling More In The Western Region. This Could Be Due To The Fact That There Are More Private Citizens Who Are Neither Into Corporate Jobs Nor Work From Home Residing In That Region. as in fig.10a and fig.10b.
